Pretty JSON
===========

[Atom](http://atom.io/) plugin to format JSON documents.

Select the text to format and then execute the Pretty JSON `prettify` command. For JSON files, format the entire file automatically without need to first select the text. Minify and sorting commands are available too.

This plugin will post a notification to Atom if there is a parse error in the JSON. Disable warnings in this plugin's settings panel if you do not desire this feature.

To proactively avoid JSON errors, consider using a linter for JSON, such as the delightful [linter-jsonlint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-jsonlint).
