    Here’s the original Coffee Log after decoding:
    dayone://post?entry=#coffee #log
    If you wish, you can add a leading and tailing pipe to each line of the table.
    Use the form that you like. As an illustration, this will give the same result as above:
    Note: A table need at least one pipe on each line for Markdown Extra to parse
    it correctly. This means that the only way to create a one-column table is to
    add a leading or a tailing pipe, or both of them, to each line.
    The align HTML attribute is applied to each cell of the concerned column.
    You can apply span-level formatting to the content of each cell using regular
    Markdown syntax:
    First, let’s talk about what Markdown tables look like. The full explanation
    can be found at either the PHP Markdown Extra or MultiMarkdown sites, but the
    nutshell version is this:
    The pipe (|) characters separate the columns. The alignment of each column is
    determined by the placement of the colons in the separator line. A colon at the
    left end only (or no colon at all) means left aligned; a colon at the right end
    only means right aligned; a colon at each end means centered.
    It’s nice to have the text version of the table spaced as I have it above with
    the pipes stacked on top of one another and the text aligned the way the separator
    line says. It’s very time consuming to type it in that way, though, so my tables
    tend to look more like this:
    which is easy to type, but hard to read and edit. So the first command I made
    is a Python script that takes an ugly text table and makes it pretty. Here’s the code.
