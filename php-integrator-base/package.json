The user can then select his desired combination of functionalities from these other packages:\n  * **[php-integrator-autocomplete-plus](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-autocompletion)** - Provides intelligent PHP autocompletion in combination with autocomplete-plus.\n  * **[php-integrator-navigation](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-navigation)** - Provides code navigation and go to functionality.\n  * **[php-integrator-tooltips](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-tooltips)** - Shows tooltips with documentation.\n  * **[php-integrator-annotations](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-annotations)** - Shows annotations, such as for overridden methods and interface implementations.\n  * **[php-integrator-call-tips](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-call-tips)** - Shows call tips containing parameters in your code. (Complements the autocompletion package.)\n  * **[php-integrator-refactoring](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-refactoring)** - Provides basic refactoring capabilities.\n  * **[php-integrator-linter](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-linter)** - Shows indexing errors and problems with your code.\n\nThe following package also exists, but is currently looking for a new maintainer (see also its README):\n  * **[php-integrator-symbol-viewer](https://github.com/tocjent/php-integrator-symbol-viewer)** - Provides a side panel listing class symbols with search and filter features.\n\nNote that the heavy lifting is performed by the [PHP core](https://github.com/php-integrator/core), which is automatically installed as _payload_ for this package and kept up to date automatically.\n\nThe source code was originally based on the php-autocomplete-plus code base, but has significantly diverged from it since then.\n\n## What do I need to do to make it work?\nSee [the website](https://php-integrator.github.io/#what-do-i-need) as well as [the wiki](https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-base/wiki).\n\n![GPLv3 Logo](http://gplv3.fsf.org/gplv3-127x51.png)\n",
